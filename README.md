# CleanTech Bin | Smart Dustbin

## Overview
CleanTech Bin is an automated waste management system designed to optimize waste collection and enhance sanitary conditions. This system utilizes an LPC1768 microcontroller and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect waste levels and automate the waste collection process with a stepper motor.

## Features
- **Ultrasonic Sensing**: Uses an HC-SR04 sensor to measure waste levels without physical contact, maintaining hygiene.
- **Automated Lid Operation**: The stepper motor, controlled by the LPC1768 microcontroller, automatically opens and closes the bin lid based on waste proximity.
- **LED Indicators**: Includes an LED system that signals the operational status and waste level detection.

## Components
- LPC1768 Microcontroller
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Stepper Motor
- LEDs
- Resistor (for LED current limiting)

## Hardware Setup
The hardware setup includes the LPC1768 microcontroller connected to a stepper motor and an ultrasonic sensor. The stepper motor is used for lid control, while the ultrasonic sensor detects the waste level.

## Software Development
The system is programmed in Embedded C using Keil uVision and Flash Magic tools. The main functionalities include distance measurement, motor control, and system status indication.

## Code Explanation
The repository includes the complete source code with comments explaining the functionality of each segment. The code is structured around a main loop that continuously measures the distance to the waste using the ultrasonic sensor and controls the stepper motor accordingly.

### Key Functions
- `initTimer0()`: Configures the timer used for ultrasonic sensor timing.
- `startTimer0()`: Starts the timer for echo pulse measurement.
- `stopTimer0()`: Stops the timer and calculates the echo pulse duration.
- `delayUS()`: Provides precise microsecond delays.
- `controlStepperMotor()`: Controls the stepper motor's direction and steps.
- `rotateOnceClockwise()`: Rotates the stepper motor one step clockwise.
- `rotateOnceAnticlockwise()`: Rotates the stepper motor one step anticlockwise.
